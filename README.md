# About
Hypersolve is a (work in progress) efficient 3-phase 2^4 Rubik's cube solver written in rust. It is based on [Hypersolvepy](https://github.com/ajtaurence/Hypersolvepy), a proof of concept version made in python. Hypersolve should be faster and use much less memory than Hypersolvepy. The plan is to write Hypersolve as a command line application so it can be easily integrated into other programs (making true random state scrambles a reality for 2^4). A gui will then be built on top of this for use of Hypersolve on its own.
