# About
Hypersolve is a work-in-progress efficient 3-phase [2<sup>4</sup> Rubik's cube](https://hypercubing.xyz/puzzles/2x2x2x2/) solver written in rust. Currently it is being developed as a command line application but may also have a gui built for it later. Hypersolve is capable of solving random state scrambles in only 21-24 moves STM within less than a second! It can also generate true random state scrambles, not relying on sufficiently long random sequences of moves. These random state scrambles come with a verification key that can be used to prove that the scrambles came from Hypersolve and are untampered, making scramble cheating impossible. For a full list of features see [commands](#commands). For build instructions see [building](#building).


# Commands

## Solve
Finds relatively short solutions very quickly by iteratively searching for solutions shorter than the last one, terminating with the optimal solution

## Scramble
Generates a true random state scramble with a 128 bit hexadecimal verification key for [verifying](#verify) that the scramble was randomly generated and untampered

## Verify
Verifies that a scramble is a true random state scramble generated by Hypersolve using the verification key

# Hardware Details

## CPU
Most operations that Hypersolve performs are non-parallelizable by nature so it will not benefit greatly from many CPU cores. However, the solve mode is multithreaded and may significantly benefit from CPUs capable of running up to 12 threads concurrently. The initial lookup table generation will also take advantage of all available cores.

## Ram
Hypersolve will use about 1.5 GB of ram.

## Disk Space
Hypersolve requires about 1.5 GB of disk space to store several lookup tables which are computed the first time they are needed.


# Verification Details
Hypersolve verification works by producing (or receiving) a random 128 bit key when a scramble is requested. The key is then hashed using the [SHA256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) hashing algorithm. The first 128 bits are kept and the rest are discarded. The hashed key is converted into an index ranging from 0 to 3,357,894,533,384,932,272,635,904,000 which uniquely identifies a 2<sup>4</sup> state. Now that a 2<sup>4</sup> state has been selected, Hypersolve quickly finds a sequence which solves that state. It then inverts that solution to obtain the scramble which results in that state.

During the verification process, the verification key is provided along with the scramble. Hypersolve simply re-generates the scramble from the key and ensures that the generated scramble matches the provided scramble.

This process ensures that it is essentially impossible to force Hypersolve to output a scramble for a particular desired state since this would require reversing the hash function. Additionally, one cannot pass off the scramble as their solution and their solution as the scramble by inverting them since the scramble must not just result in the correct state, but have the exact expected form.

# Building

The build process is slightly different from other Rust projects due to some data files that need to be generated for compilation.

1. Install Rust / Cargo
1. Run

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ajtaurence/Hypersolve.git
cd Hypersolve
cargo test generate --features gen-const-data --manifest-path hypersolve-lib/Cargo.toml
cargo build --release --manifest-path hypersolve/Cargo.toml
```

The above commands will generate all data files needed for `hypersolve-lib` and build the command line interface.
